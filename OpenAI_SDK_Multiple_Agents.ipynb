      "\n",
      "Private health insurance in Australia is designed to complement the public healthcare system, known as Medicare, offering coverage for services not fully paid by the government. It provides various plans that can cover hospital stays, medical services, and ancillary treatments like dental and physiotherapy, allowing individuals to access a broader range of healthcare options. The market features a mix of government incentives and regulations aimed at encouraging citizens to take up private insurance, thereby alleviating pressure on public hospitals.\n",
