The projetc is credited to (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho7ZliXuJLk&t=1597s), where I learnt how to use OpenAI SDK to build multiple agents.

## Project brief
The project builds 3 agents that will produce one article with topic summary and outlines, the summary and outlines will be checked by an agnet for quality control purpose before producing final output.
